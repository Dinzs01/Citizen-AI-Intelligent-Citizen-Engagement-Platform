Citizen AI: Intelligent Citizen Engagement Platform üó£Ô∏è


The Citizen AI project is an intelligent platform designed to revolutionize how citizens interact with government services by leveraging generative AI technology. The goal is to enhance transparency, efficiency, and public trust by automating information delivery and enabling real-time feedback. The platform empowers citizens to easily access personalized information on government policies, civic rights, and service procedures.


üéØ Purpose

 * Improve Communication: Enhance channels between the government and citizens.
 * Simplify Access: Provide easier and faster access to public service information.
 * Empower Citizens: Simplify complex governance information for everyone.
 * Collect Feedback: Gather structured, actionable citizen feedback to inform policy adjustments.
   
‚ú® Features

 * Conversational Interface: An intuitive chatbot that uses a natural language processing model to understand complex queries and provide relevant answers or follow-up questions. For example, a citizen can ask, "How can I renew my driver's license?" and receive information on eligibility, required documents, and a link to the official portal.
 * Sentiment Analysis Dashboard: Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect public opinion trends, categorizing feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. This helps officials monitor public satisfaction and adjust strategies.
 * Policy Summarization: Converts dense legal and policy documents into easy-to-read summaries, highlighting key points, eligibility, and procedures.
 * Resource Navigation & Discovery: Provides a smart directory of government departments, contacts, and online portals, dynamically suggesting the most relevant resources based on the user's query.
 * Multilingual Support: The system supports multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and Spanish, to allow non-native speakers to engage effectively with public services.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built on principles of scalability, modularity, and fault tolerance.
 * Frontend: Developed with Gradio for quick prototyping of a web-based chat and dashboard interface.
 * Backend API: Implemented in Flask, it manages session handling, validates requests, and integrates with the LLM service.
 * LLM Service: IBM Granite models serve as the AI engine, fine-tuned for civic engagement and policy tasks to provide accurate, context-aware responses.
 * Database: A PostgreSQL database stores user queries, session histories, and sentiment metrics for analysis and reporting.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
 * Python 3.8+ and Git installed.
 * Familiarity with virtual environments.
 * A Google Colab account for GPU-based model inference.
 * An IBM Watsonx API key from the IBM Cloud platform.

Workflow
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/example/CitizenAI.git
 * Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
 * Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
 * Configure API key:
   Store your IBM Watsonx API key in a .env file or as a system environment variable.

Running the Application
 * Open Google Colab and select the 'T4 GPU' runtime.
 * Clone the repository and run the main script. Gradio will provide a public URL for interaction.
   !python app.py

üõ°Ô∏è Planned Security Enhancements
The current implementation is an open demo without user authentication. Future plans include:
 * OAuth2 Integration: For government officials, leveraging IBM Cloud identity services.
 * JWT Authentication: To enable secure, token-based user sessions for citizens.
 * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): To define different permissions for citizens and officials.
 * API Key Management: Securely storing and encrypting API keys.

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
 * Hallucinations: The occasional generation of incorrect or misleading information
 * * Rate Limiting: Potential slowdowns during peak usage.
 * Latency: Complex queries may introduce a 1-3 second delay.
 * No Live Updates: The system doesn't reflect the latest government updates without external data feeds.
 * Data Privacy: PII management requires a GDPR-compliant solution.

üöÄ Future Enhancements
 * Real-Time Database Integration: To query the live status of government services.
 * Proactive Notifications: To push alerts about policy changes or service outages via SMS or email.
 * Mobile Application Development: Native apps for Android and iOS with an offline mode.
 * Multimodal Interface: Allowing voice commands and document image uploads for processing.
